## How to Run the System
1.  Set up a local server environment such as *XAMPP* on your device
2.  Place all project files in the server's root directory (e.g. htdocs folder for XAMPP)
3.  Import the included SQL script to create the required database and tables
4.  Access the system via your browser using the URL: localhost/student_info_system/index.php
